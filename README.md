A simple GUI-based text editor with syntax highlighting for the C programming language.
The text editor packs only the barest features, which enables anyone to extend its functionality to include 
line numbering, language-specific syntax highlighting, copy-paste operations, opening multiple tabs, etc. 

Since this is a hobby project of mine, I might integrate these features in subsequent updates. 

Feel free to use and modify it!
